Here is how you set it up

First unzip the file, once that's done, open the terminal and change directory into 
$cd (wherever the file is)
$cd devChallenge
$cd project1
$npm install

Once everything is installed, run the application by running the command below

$npm start

The application should start in http://localhost:3000/. If there is an error, it is likely there is 
another application running on that port/server. So it'll ask if you want it to run on http://localhost:3001/
In that case say yes

If there is any question let me know!
